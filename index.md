# Welcome to the Phitonex Github Resource

We are sharing our 40 color flow cytometry data set as a start of this resource.  This site intended to show what is possible in leveraging our fluorescent labels, and serve as a reference for opportunities and challenges in high parameter panel design.  


## 40 color Experiment 

Pushing the envelope should not mean more difficult data analysis or panel design, and we set out to prove this.  Based on a previously shared multicolor panel of 35 colors [https://cytekbio.com/pages/aurora#tab-data], we started with the 34 commercially available conjugated antibodies and dropped in an 6 additional NovaFluor-conjugated antibodies.  Thanks to NovaFluor spectral clarity, performance, and easy conjugation, we were able to immediately plug and play 6 additional colors with limited impact on the current panel, thus pushing our ability to perform deep immunophenotyping without adding complexity in either panel design or data analysis.
