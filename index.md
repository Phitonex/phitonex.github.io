# Welcome to the Phitonex Github Resource

We are sharing our 40 color flow cytometry data set as a start of this resource.  This site intended to show what is possible in leveraging our fluorescent labels, and serve as a reference for opportunities and challenges in high parameter panel design.  


## 40 color Experiment 

Pushing the envelope should not mean more difficult data analysis or panel design, and we set out to prove this.  Based on a previously shared multicolor panel of 35 colors [1], we started with the 34 commercially available conjugated antibodies and dropped in an 6 additional NovaFluor-conjugated antibodies.  Thanks to NovaFluor spectral clarity, performance, and easy conjugation, we were able to immediately plug and play 6 additional colors with limited impact on the current panel, thus pushing our ability to perform deep immunophenotyping without adding complexity in either panel design or data analysis.

# Acknowledgements
We are deeply grateful to the team at Cytek Biosciences who provided us conjugated antibodies, assisted us with SpectroFlo software, and their helpful discussions.  We also want to thank the University of North Carolina Cytometry Core especially Nancy Fisher, Ramiro Diz, and Ayrianna Woody for their help and partnership.  A big thank you as well to other vendors who assisted us in obtaining reagents, as an experiment like this requires some serious juice.  Additionally, a bright and clean thank you is owed to our customer-collaborator (you know who you are, thank you!), Ian Taylor of FlowJo/BD for unmixing support and analysis, Danielle Huppe for her design and critical eye, and Alvin Lebeck for his leadership.  

Finally, we are deeply indebted to the numerous customer conversations that informed and pushed our work and our goal to raise the bar in flow cytometry consumables.
